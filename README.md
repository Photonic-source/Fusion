Fusion is a 32bit OpenGL port of Duke Nukem 3D with a focus on peer to peer network stability and ease of use.

Fusion uses URL links to initiate net games as well as keeping compatability with the original command line methods.

Fusion uses a new argument to host/join games from internet links, desktop shortcuts... 
  For the host simply "fusion:-host" to start a 2 player game
  To connect it's "fusion:-join [HOSTS_IP_ADDRESS]"
