     (other than a fewer than 250 node BBS) that charges for online access
     time, online service providing multiplayer use, CD-ROM, catalog, and
     retail rack REQUIRES WRITTEN PERMISSION (which 3D Realms may withhold in
     its discretion) AND PRE-PAYMENT OF A LICENSE FEE OR OTHER MUTUALLY AGREED
     BENEFIT.  Interested persons are invited to contact 3D Realms (proposals
     welcome).

[4]  NEW LEVELS.

     "New Levels" are data that modify or substitute for Game data, thus
     modifying or replacing one or more Game levels.  Creating or distributing
     a New Level or a software tool that has no substantial purpose other than
     to contribute to the creation of a New Level infringes rights of 3D Realms
     and is prohibited by law except as permitted by 3D Realms.  3D REALMS
     PERMITS NEW LEVELS ONLY THAT MEET ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:

 [A] The Level must only work with a RETAIL episode of the Game. It must NOT
     work with this Episode One.

 [B] The level must not contain modifications to any COM, EXE, or DLL, or to
     other executable file.

 [C] The level must not contain any illegal or indecent material, or (without
     appropriate irrevocable licenses) any trademarks, copyright protected
     work, or other property of third parties.

 [D] The level must prominently identify at least in every online description
     and with reasonable duration on an opening screen
     (1) the name and email address of the level's creators, and
     (2) the words "THIS LEVEL IS NOT MADE BY OR SUPPORTED BY 3D REALMS".

 [E] The level and any use of it must be offered solely for free (other than
     any incidental online charges).

 [F] By distributing or permitting the distribution of any New Level, all
     owners of any trademark, copyright or other right, title or interest
     therein (to the extent different from the Game as originally distributed
     by 3D Realms) grant back to 3D Realms an irrevocable royalty free right
     to distribute the level.

 [G] The distributor of any New Level or Level Editor must be authorized to
     distribute the Game itself (either in writing, or by being within a
     category where no writing is needed under this LICENSE.DOC).

[5]  TERM: Unless terminated for cause, grants by 3D Realms under this
     LICENSE.DOC terminate 30 days after receipt of written notice, or such
     longer period as the notice may provide.  Sections [2], [6], and [7]
     survive termination.

[6]  LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF REMEDIES: If 3D Realms provides a
     physically defective copy of the Game, 3D Realms will replace it upon
     prompt submission of the defective one.  THE GAME IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED
     "AS-IS", AND NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
     ARE MADE AS TO IT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON.  OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND
     YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS SUCH REPLACEMENT, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
     WILL WE PROVIDE ANY OTHER REMEDY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
     CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM IT,
     INCLUDING SUCH FROM NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR BREACH OF WARRANTY
     OR CONTRACT, EVEN AFTER NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

[7]  MISCELLANY

 [A] Since we (3D Realms) would be irreparably damaged if Sections [2], [3],
     [4], or [7][D] were not specifically enforced, we will be entitled without
     bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable
     remedies with respect to breaches of such sections, in addition to such
     other remedies as we may have.

 [B] You will indemnify and hold us, our partners, affiliates, contractors,
     employees and agents harmless from damage, loss and expense arising
     directly or indirectly from your acts and omissions in copying,
     distributing or modifying the Game or any New Level.

 [C] With respect to every matter arising under this, you consent to the
     exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts sitting
     in Dallas, Texas, and to service by certified mail, return receipt
     requested, or as otherwise permitted by law.

 [D] Except as explicitly permitted herein, you will not modify the Game.
     Except to the extent, if any, applicable law may require otherwise, you
     will not decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the Game, or use or
     disclose any confidential information that it contains.

This version of the license.doc superceedes any previous versions of said
document relating to the Game.  (This Game specifically, and not other titles
published by 3D Realms or Apogee.)
